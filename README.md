## General Information
The Idea for the app was born cause I have been working in the shipbuilding industry for several years and my company had a problem with accounting for sea trial.
The construction of the ship is divided into a few stages. The main stages of building a ship are designed, purchasing, building, commissioning and trials at sea. 
This app focuses on dock trials and sea trial phase. 
During sea trials, the shipowner and the contractor supervise if scheduled trials go according to the trial plan.
If the ship's performance and efficiency are as previously agreed, the trials are passed.

If the ship fails sea trial. The shipowner has the right to request corrections to the tested areas. The application allows you to create a list of sea trials and assign comments to them if the trial was not successful.
